  "- When combining CUSTOMER_MEETINGS and CUSTOMER_MEETING_OUTCOMES, always use a LEFT JOIN to preserve meetings even if no outcome exists.
  - Round all DEAL_VALUE and other monetary fields to two decimal places in the final SELECT clause.
  - When grouping or filtering by quarter, use the FISCAL_QUARTER column rather than calendar quarter.
  - If the user’s question does not include a LIMIT, append LIMIT 1000 to prevent accidentally returning massive result sets.
  - If the user asks about Gen AI capabilities, add to your WHERE clause: SNOWFLAKE_FEATURE IN ('Document AI','Snowpark','Cortex AI NLQ')."
